This includes teachers and students alike who may want to either study teach learn or do simple research of it. The book is a type of encyclopedia that will compare and contrast the English language to Turkish and includes English-to-Turkish translations.The book will start by exploring the history of both languages. In Unit One it will explore the concepts of phonet­ics and phonology of the American English dialect at the primary level. Unit Two will then focus on the linguistic study of syntax at the primary level. This will include learning the nine lexical categories as well as understanding what phrases and phrase structure rules are et cetera. Unit Three will then go on to cover the grammatical notions of contractions and wh-questions. Unit Four will finish the volume by bringing up the idea of tenses.Unit Five which begins Volume Two will consist of nearly everything about English grammar. Unit Six will finish the volume by bringing up the linguists concept of affixation. Unit Seven aka Volume Three for A is for Adjective is a compendium of useful words phrases and expressions organized by category (e.g. foods and sports).The goal of these books is to teach the English language its grammar and the sciences behind it. For some having a supportive instructor might be needed. In the end anyone who can comprehend the information from front to back will therefore become more aware of the language than that of the average speaking L1-native-English speaker. This is guaranteed.",

Taking its cue from the conclusions drawn from project-based learning more broadly which point to the impact of project-based work on learning and development discourse socialization subject engagement and collaborative skills the book highlights how these discussions might be extended and enhanced within the context of language learning. The volume begins with discussions of philosophical and theoretical models of PBLL and is followed by case studies from contributors from a range of learning contexts and geographic regions which demonstrate these models in practice with a focus on the implementation of technology in such instances. The book also introduces resources for aligning projects with government standards in the classroom but also frameworks for researching and assessing PBLL.

The chapters dig deep into the intricacies of teaching close critical reading; unpack insights into using traditional rhetorical forms and canons; and explore a miscellany of issues related to teaching research fostering student inquiry and developing effective practices of assessment. While the authors acknowledge and build on their backgrounds with Advanced Placement the book is not solely focused on issues related to AP.

      "rating": 4.5,
      "description": "This book examines the challenges posed by English a foreign language as a language of teaching and learning for community secondary schools in Tanzania in terms of academic performance. The book probes the necessity for having two languages of instruction in the Tanzanian educational system. While Kiswahili the native language is predominantly understood by the majority of people the discussion in this book indicates that most students in community secondary schools in Tanzania are incompetent in understanding writing listening reading and speaking English a language they use in learning and doing their examinations especially in the early stages of their secondary studies. The incompetence in the above-mentioned skills is mostly caused by their inability to cope with the abrupt transition in the languages of instruction from their pre-primary and primary school study [Kiswahili] to secondary school study [English]. Moreover most teachers are unable to use the English language as a means to impart knowledge or facilitate learning to their students leading them to code-switching and code-mixing. This book poses a challenge to countries whose students pass through a transition from one language of instruction to another in their educational systems helping them to make appropriate decisions in regard to the appropriate language of teaching and learning. This book is succinctly sequential to earlier research done on the question of the language medium of instruction in Tanzania and elsewhere in Africa. . . . The book is a must read for educationalists regarding the delivery of knowledge in Africa and elsewhere where the language question continues to affect and haunt the teaching and learning process bound to the shackles of the use of former colonial languages as a means of instruction. --F. E. M. K. Senkoro University of Namibia It is correctly argued that the low proficiency of the English language among students and teachers is responsible for poor performance in secondary school examinations. The government and stakeholders must take heed of the research findings and recommendations in this book since English will continue to be used as a teaching and learning language in schools in the country for a long time. The book is strongly recommended to policymakers students teachers and parents in Tanzania. --Uswege M.

      "rating": 3.6,
      "description": "The Kimberley Arafuran language Worrorra was spoken traditionally on the remote coastline and precipitously beautiful hinterland between the Walcott Inlet and the Prince Regent River. The language described here is that attested by its last full speakers Patsy Lulpunda Amy Peters and Daisy Utemorrah. Patsy Lulpunda was a child when Europeans first entered her country in 1912 and Amy Peters and Daisy Utemorrah both grew up on the Kunmunya mission. This comprehensive and detailed grammar provides as well an historical and cultural context for a society now drastically altered. In the 1950s Worrorra people left their traditional land and from the 1970s the number of people speaking Worrorra as their first language declined dramatically. Worrorra is a highly polysynthetic language characterised by overarching concord and a high degree of morphological fusion. Verbal semantics involve a voicing opposition and an extensive system of evidentiality-marking. Worrorra has elaborate systems of pragmatic reference a derivational morphology that projects agreement-class concord across most lexical categories and complex predicates that incorporate one verb within another. Nouns are distributed among five genders the intensional properties of which define dynamic oppositions between men and women on the one hand and earth and sky on the other. This volume will be of interest to morphologists syntacticians semanticists anthropologists typologists and readers interested in Australian language and culture generally.",

      "rating": 3.0,
      "description": "HISTORY EDUCATION IS IN DECLINE because it fails to provide knowledge useful in the future as other school subjects do. This book calls on history teachers to restore the power of historical learning.Education exists to impart knowledge useful in the future. School subjects other than history identify general principles derived from their subject matter that describe how the world works principles that can be applied in the future such as addition in mathematics grammar in language and gravity in science. These disciplines pass on their general principles to teachers who pass on this knowledge to students. Historians however concentrate on describing events of the past. Without general principles to impart history teachers are left to recount one-time bygone events most of which have little or no relevance to the present and future. Without principles useful in the future history is unable to fulfill the purpose of education the way other school subjects do; society has no practical means to learn from the past; and the cycle of historical ignorance can perpetuate indefinitely. Educators commonly try to compensate for history schoolings lack of knowledge useful in the future by emphasizing skills knowledge instead: critical thinking skills or the job skills of professional historians. Other school subjects also have their critical thinking skills and professional practices but in these other disciplines general principles constitute the foundation of learning because knowledge of how the world works is a necessary prerequisite to critical thinking. In history education that prerequisite is missing. The truth is history has been supplying humans with useful principles of knowledge for at least 2400 years since the time of Thucydides in Greece and Sun Tzu in China. In earlier times history could involve more than the act of describing past events; it could involve the ambition to derive from events principles useful in the future an ambition that the history profession has largely abandoned. This loss deprives historical learning of the power possessed by other intellectual disciplines. If historians wish to concentrate on the role of describing events of the past thats their business. Then the task of providing knowledge useful in the future falls to history educators because thats their business.FUNDAMENTALS OF FUTURE-FOCUSED HISTORY TEACHING INCLUDEFive basic principles of history educationA coherent and useful purpose to guide instructionFour kinds of historical knowledge relevant to the futureCriteria for weighing the importance of historical eventsFour essential cognitive learning strategies Author Maxwell believes that Future-Focused History Teaching has the potential to restore to historical learning the power that it once held but has since lost; to return history to its rightful place of prominence among the fundamental realms of knowledge taught in school and college; and to provide important knowledge of how the world works that can help students and society to function effectively in the future.Note: This book is not a classroom teaching guide with a collection of handy lesson plans. This book deals with fundamental premises and practices that underlie the work of every history teacher from grade school through graduate school.",

However since this is not a grammar book this program will not teach you these skills nor will it teach you the accusative genitive dative instrumental or prepositional cases. The only thing this book offers are the necessary tools to become conversational in a foreign language in record time. As previously stated though with regards to grammar and pronunciation you are on your own! This is one of the several in a series of instructional language guides the Nitzany Methods revolutionary approach is the only one in the world that uses its unique language technology to actually enable you to speak and understand native speakers in the shortest amount of time possible.

      "description": "Have you always wanted to learn how to speak Dutch but simply didnt have the time? Well if so then look no further. You can hold in your hands one of the most advanced and revolutionary method that was ever designed for quickly becoming conversational in a language. In creating this time-saving program master linguist Yatir Nitzany spent years examining the twenty-seven most common languages in the world and distilling from them the three hundred and fifty words that are most likely to be used in real conversations. These three hundred and fifty words were chosen in such a way that they were structurally interrelated and when combined form sentences. Through various other discoveries about how real conversations work--discoveries that are detailed further in this book--Nitzany created the necessary tools for linking these words together in a specific way so that you may become rapidly and almost effortlessly conversant--now. If your desire is to learn complicated grammatical rules or to speak perfectly proper and precise Dutch this book is not for you. However if you need to actually hold a conversation while on a trip to the Netherlands to impress that certain someone or to be able to speak with your grandfather or grandmother as soon as possible then the Nitzany Method is what you have been looking for. This method is designed for fluency in a foreign language while communicating in the present tense. Nitzany believes that whats most important is actually being able to understand and be understood by another human being right away. More formalized training in grammar rules etc. can come later. This is one of the several in a series of instructional language guides the Nitzany Methods revolutionary approach is the only one in the world that uses its unique language technology to actually enable you to speak and understand native speakers in the shortest amount of time possible. No more depending on volumes of books of fundamental beginner intermediate and advanced levels all with hundreds of pages in order to learn a language. With Conversational Dutch Quick and Easy all you need are forty-six pages. Learn Dutch today not tomorrow and get started now!",

In these three novellas-written between 1901 and 1933-Tagore focuses on the subtle nuances of unsanctioned relationships exploring feelings of loneliness and worthlessness in middle-class housewives in colonial Bengal. They display Tagores remarkable understanding of a womans psyche with all three works underlining the incompatibility between husbands and wives and how the ensuing void lead to forbidden relationships. In Charulata Sharmila and Neeraja-the three strong yet vulnerable heroines-Tagore presents emerging new women with thoughts and desires of their own. While Sukhendu Rays new translations retain the cultural and linguistic ambience of the original Bharati Rays Introduction places these works in the social context of early-twentieth-century Bengal.",

      "description": "In 2016 the Centre for Biblical Linguistics Translation and Exegesis (CBLTE) a research center located at McMaster Divinity College hosted the annual Bingham Colloquium. Scholars from around North America were invited to participate in a collegial and collaborative dialogue on what is currently happening (or could happen) at the intersection of linguistics and biblical studies particularly in regards to the linguistic study of biblical languages their translation and the way that linguistic methods can contribute to the interpretation of the biblical texts. This volume of essays publishes many of the presentations that took place at the Colloquium. This fascinating collection of essays showcases the value of modern linguistics for responsible exegesis and effective translation of the Greek New Testament. Readers will find the range of perspectives and applications of modern linguistics in this brief volume a helpful bridge into an interpretive tool that is often neglected. --Martin Culy Founding Editor Baylor Handbook on the Greek New Testament Director Cypress Hills Ministries One cannot possibly read what emanates from McMaster Divinity College without treading across that intersection between Hellenistic Greek and cutting edge linguistic exploration. Whether its text corpora discourse analytical clausal lexical or other issues the payoff is always fresh exegetical understanding allied with pastoral implications--i.e. exactly what is needed in study and informed ministry today and presented here via a pleasant diversity of conceptual and textual connections. --Jonathan M. Watt Professor of Biblical Studies Geneva College and Reformed Presbyterian Theological Seminary Stanley Porter has been a leader in the field of application of linguistic theory to the interpretation of the New Testament and study of Greek grammar. In this collection of essays he assembles an impressive group of scholars who address a wide range of issues related to the application of linguistics to interpreting the Greek text. More specifically this volume focuses on the application of Systemic Functional Linguistics in the tradition of M. A. K. Halliday. This volume will provide a solid and up-to-date introduction and discussion of the importance and usage of Systemic Functional Linguistics for New Testament students. This book is a must-read for anyone unfamiliar with linguistic approaches to the New Testament or anyone who wants to explore further the value and implications of Systemic Functional Linguistics for interpreting the New Testament. I highly recommend it. --David Mathewson Associate Professor of New Testament Denver Seminary Stanley E. Porter is President Dean and Professor of New Testament as well as holder of the Roy A. Hope Chair in Christian Worldview at McMaster Divinity College Hamilton Ontario Canada. He is a prolific writer and editor in the area of Greek linguistics and the Founder of the Centre for Biblical Linguistics Translation and Exegesis. Christopher D.

      "rating": "4.8",
      "description": "Description: This book uses insights from a modern theory of communication Relevance Theory to examine the function of the particle i(/na [SET IN SpIonic] in New Testament Greek. It claims that the particle does not have a lexical meaning of in order that contrary to accepted wisdom but that it alerts the reader to expect an interpretation of the thought or attitude of the implied speaker or author. Evidence is adduced from pagan Greek and in particular the writings of Polybius Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Epictetus as well as the New Testament. The implications of this claim give an opportunity for a fresh interpretation of many problematic texts. Endorsements: This timely and fascinating study is of interest not only to biblical scholars but also to those interested in linguistic theory. Margaret Sims original study of the purpose marker i3na utilises the notion of metarepresentation familiar from Relevance Theory to provide new insight into the interpretation of certain key texts in the Gospels. In so doing she shows how the ideas of theoretical pragmatics can be brought to bear on the study of other fields to enable new and exciting perspectives to be opened up on difficult problems of translation and interpretation. Ronnie Cann University of Edinburgh A model dissertation accounting for an important long-ignored question. Literary and non-literary extra-biblical sources have been considered and the perspective is diachronic distinguishing earlier and later usage from that of the New Testament. It is grounded in linguistic theory but free of jargon and intelligible to those not trained in Linguistics. Carl W. Conrad Washington University St. Louis Missouri This is a major innovative thesis in which insights from linguistic study (Relevance Theory) are used to free our understanding of the Greek particle i3na from the shackles of a fixed lexical meaning to one that is based on the communicators intention thus widening its scope from the traditional translation as in order that (purpose). The implications of this carefully argued monograph for the interpretation of theological texts in the New Testament especially those that are generally assumed to deal with divine purposes are highly significant. I. Howard Marshall University of Aberdeen Dr. Margaret Sim has an excellent solution to the problem that one Greek word can introduce very different clauses--expressing purpose or result but also requests wishes and opinions. Using Relevance Theory from linguistics and well aware of the long history of the Greek language she infers that we do not have a word with one meaning which has been weakened but rather a word whose function is to signal a thought about a state of affairs which is potential rather than actual. Drawing examples from wider Hellenistic Greek and from our own use of language she throws a flood of light on difficult biblical passages.

Sim is an International Translation Consultant with SIL and has been lecturing in New Testament at Africa International University since 1992.",

While touching on the key structural aspects of language (phonetics phonology morphology and syntax) it does not simply give an overview but rather provides a way to study and talk about language. Each chapter includes practical steps and suggests tools for applying different kinds of linguistic knowledge in classrooms. The activities and exercises are adaptable to elementary or high school settings. Many examples focus on the intersection of math science and language. Teacher case studies show how real teachers have used these concepts to inform teaching practices. Given the increasing use of multimedia resources in today’s schools multiple mediums are integrated to engage educators in learning about language. The Companion Website provides a multitude of relevant resources that illustrate the diversity of language functions and debates about language in society.",

      "rating": "3.8",
      "description": "Yoshiyuki Junnosuke was a sensual writer whose style is reminiscent of that of novelists such as Tanizaki Junichiro and Nagai Kafu. His works deal with the possibility of emotional purity in the relationships between men and women. Often the relationship is examined through the agency of the protagonists association with prostitutes. In the preface to New Writing in Japan Mishima Yukio says of Yoshiyuki: The delicacy of Yoshiyukis language and sensibility is probably more subtle and sophisticated than that of any Japanese writer since the war...The idée fixe of Japanese youth today-that love is impossible and impracticable-lies deep at the root of Yoshiyukis thinking. His elegant prose style is often likened to that of Albert Camus. Howard Hibbett said of Yoshiyuki (in Contemporary Japanese Literature: an Anthology of Fiction Film and Other Writing Since 1945): The cool polished surface of his fiction faithfully reflects a world of mingled frivolity and futility...The urbane refinement of his astringent prose style is much admired.Toward Dusk which in 1978 won the Noma Prize Japans highest literary award is considered to be Yoshiyukis best work in the rensaku form: a series of stories or chapters bound by common theme. The story ostensibly revolves around Sasa the middle-aged protagonist his fascination with virginity and in particular his obsessive quest for an emotional purity in his mistress Sugiko. In many ways the main theme is similar to that in The Dark Room (winner of the prestigious Tanizaki Prize; translated into English by John Bester). As the critic James Kirkup pointed out The postwar mood of disillusionment made Yoshiyuki see the love lives of men and women as fragile and unreliable fleeting irresponsible. Like Nakata in The Dark Room Sasa also lives for his assignations. And although (unlike Nakata) he is married with a daughter his family life is empty and meaningless and his home simply somewhere to stay when he is not seeing his mistresses. Sasa wished to keep his relationships casual at arms length and he arranges them to suit himself. But ultimately he realizes that he and Sugiko must go their separate ways and that nothing lasts forever.Toward Dusk is joined here by a selection of some of his finest short stories and all of the pieces in this collection are published here for the first time in English.",

      "rating": "4.0",
      "description": "The book presents the aesthetic of narrative employed by literary discourse through the literary works of some Arab writers renowned in the Arab World and at international levels as well as some Palestinian writers in Israel through literary models dealing with reality in the areas of: poetry short story and novel and through a critical view trying to elucidate the intellectual and literary value of those literary models. The book also examines the various aesthetic values that have been employed and integrated into the literary text comprising vocabulary definition artistic image and intertextuality etc. Needless to emphasize that our choice of those writers mentioned within the book was not based arbitrarily on the fact that some of them had benefited from the opportunity of critical writing and publishing particularly the Egyptian writers Najib Mahfouz winner of the Nobel Prize for literature in 1988 and Youssef Idris. On the contrary most of the Palestinian writers inside Israel did not get the attention and care they deserved from the critics and publishers. Also we hope that the book will fill an existing vacuum in Arab literary studies especially in English. The significance of this study is that it provides the opportunity perhaps for the first time to expose to the reader and learner as well as to everyone interested in Arabic literature--Arabs as well as foreigners--the essence of the Palestinian literary movement specifically inside Israel through special models of the product of some of these creators which were produced under the shadow of social cultural and political conditions of the most difficult kind. Also the study presents critical models that can constitute a qualitative addition to the Palestinian literary works inside Israel as well as to the literary works in the Arab world. It was necessary to monitor those literary activities not only in the Arabic language but also in a universal foreign language. This may require opening windows towards others in order to achieve the greatest possible acculturation and the dialogue of civilizations in all fields of life and knowledge. This can give the Palestinian literary movement inside Israel a golden opportunity to advance and spread on a larger scale--and therein we will find the meaning of human happiness.",

      "description": "Rabindranath Tagores 1913 Nobel Prize in Literature helped renew interest in modern Indian literature and in particular Bengali literature. However by the mid-nineteenth century Bengali literature had already come into its own distinguishing itself in the genres of poetry short story novel and essays of intellection and reminiscence. It grew diversely and through many channels in the twentieth century a period of social change and upheaval. The Oxford India Anthology of Bengali Literature celebrates the richness and diversity of the literature spread across 130 years. The two-volume anthology represents around 100 writers and includes nearly 250 selections from poetry short fiction and non-fiction. The chronological dividing line of 1941 between the two volumes represents not just the end of an era with Tagores death but the beginning of a new period marked by traumatic changes in both Bengals amply reflected in the literature. This volume begins with Jibanananda Dass poetry and moves on to Amiya Chakravarty Sudhindranath Datta Bishnu Dey Buddhadeva Bose Shamsur Rahman Sankha Ghosh among others ending with Joy Goswami and Mandakranta Sen. The short fiction and non-fiction sections are similarly characterized by chronological and diverse selections many of them translated especially for this volume. Of extraordinary literary merit and variety the close to 150 selections stand out as an important social register offering glimpses of changing times social ethos and varying writing styles concerns and viewpoints. Carefully selected and introduced the chronological listing of works by authors helps readers get a sense of evolution of various literary genres and sub-genres across almost one and a half centuries of literary creation. Placing the writings in their historical context the Introduction affords a broad conceptual understanding of the socio-political and cultural mores of the times.",

      "description": "Fakir Mohan Senapati laid the foundation of Odia short stories with the publication of Rebati in 1898 about a hundred and twenty two years ago. Ever since the genre has evolved much. He wrote about twenty short stories between 1898 and 1916. Critics have accepted this phase as the first phase of Odia story writing. The period between 1910 and 1947 is known as the second phase in the life of Odia short stories. This was the period when realism progressive thoughts Gandhian ideals Marxism the freedom struggle etc. had their impacts. The story writers were guided by an instinct to reform the society serve people and help in promotion of nationalistic feelings. After the 1960s writers started delving deep into the sub-conscious state of mind and analyzing it minutely. Besides a period of quest or search for knowledge ensued. The writers were more serious about their quest into life world death sorrow and suffering. This was a phase when the conservative mindset was set aside. This apart many movements like Humanism Socialism Existentialism Symbolism etc. took the writers into their grips. This anthology has thirty-one Odia short stories translated into English. Each story gives a new taste in so far as treatment of the subject matter and style are concerned. We have past masters who have carved a niche for themselves. More than half of our writers have been conferred with either the Odisha Sahitya Akademi award or the Central Sahitya Akademi award or both. We also have new talents who are venturing to touch the sky.

About the Author Marina Tsvetaeva was born in Moscow in 1892 the daughter of a pianist and a museum curator. After enjoying a relatively secure and comfortable childhood she published her first poems in 1910 and in 1911 married fellow poet Sergei Efron. They had two daughters before the Russian revolution broke out and it was at that time she began to experience the turmoil and brutality of early twentieth-century Russia. During the years of famine that ensued she was forced to place her daughters in a State orphanage where one of them died of malnutrition. Tsvetaeva later followed her husband to Czechoslovakia where they lived in exile until Efron’s return to Russia in 1937. Efron subsequently was arrested and died in a labor camp. Tsvetaeva returned to Russia with their son in 1939 but was driven to despair by the difficulty of finding food for the both of them and in 1941 she hanged herself. Along with Pasternak Mandelstam and Akhmatova Marina Tsvetaeva stands as one of the four great Russian poets of this century and is one of the most important woman writers in the Western canon.Elaine Feinstein is a prizewinning poet and novelist and the author of highly praised biographies of Alexander Pushkin Marina Tsvetaeva and Ted Hughes.

      "description": "The best classic antiquity collections in this set are The Iliad and The Odyssey The darkest chapter of the Trojan War is described in Homers Iliad. The most legendary Greek warrior Achilles who was humiliated by his leader Agamemnon refuses to engage in combat. But after the Trojan Hector murders Patroclus a close friend of Achilles he rushes back into combat to exact revenge even though he knows that doing so will guarantee his own quick demise. The Odyssey according to the Guardian is a poem of remarkable pleasures: it is a salt-caked storm-tossed wine-dark treasure of tales of many twists and turns like life itself. One of the earliest and best pieces of Western literature is the epic story of Odysseus and his ten-year journey home after the Trojan War. The sea god Poseidon and other natural and supernatural dangers including shipwrecks conflicts monsters and his unyielding hate force Odysseus to employ his bravery and intelligence to reach his country and conquer the challenges that still await him there. Augustine who is regarded as one of the most significant figures in the early Western church had dabbled with a number of philosophies before accepting Christianity at the age of 31. St. Augustine continues to be a strong proponent of orthodoxy and the episcopacy as the only channel for the distribution of saving grace today. The Poetics has shaped how people view drama. Malcolm Heath provided the translation notes and introduction. Using examples from the plays of Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides the Poetics brought such fundamental terms as mimesis (imitation) hamartia (error) and katharsis (purification) into literary criticism. Aristotle describes how intricacy and resolution recognition and reversals are key components of the most powerful tragedies. During the time leading up to Boethiuss cruel execution THE CONSOLATION was written. It is a conversation between the sick prisoner and his nurse Philosophy that alternates between text and verse. He regains his health and achieves enlightenment as a result of her teachings on the nature of fortune and pleasure good and evil fate and free will. The Consolation was widely read in mediaeval Europe and Chaucer and Dante both incorporated some of his concepts into their writings.",

      "rating": "3.9",
      "description": "The emergence of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Standards in 1989 sparked a sea change in thinking about the nature and quality of mathematics instruction in U.S. schools. Much is known about transmission forms of mathematics teaching and the influence of this teaching on students learning but there is still little knowledge about the alternative forms of instruction that have evolved from the recent widespread efforts to reform mathematics education. Beyond Classical Pedagogy: Teaching Elementary School Mathematics reports on the current state of knowledge about these new instructional practices which differ in significant ways from the traditional pedagogy that has permeated mathematics education in the past. This book provides a research-based view of the nature of facilitative teaching in its relatively mature form along with opposing views and critique of this form of pedagogy. The focus is on elementary school mathematics classrooms where the majority of the reform-based efforts have occurred and on the micro level of teaching (classroom interaction) as a source for revealing the complexity involved in teaching teachers learning and the impact of both on childrens learning. The work in elementary mathematics teaching is situated in the larger context of research on teaching. Research and insights from three disciplinary perspectives are presented: the psychological perspective centers on facilitative teaching as a process of teachers learning; the mathematical perspective focuses on the nature of the mathematical knowledge teachers need in order to engage in this form of teaching; the sociological perspective attends to the interactive process of meaning construction as teachers and students create intellectual communities in their classrooms. The multidisciplinary perspectives presented provide the editors with the necessary triangulation to provide confirming evidence and rich detail about the nature of facilitative teaching. Audiences for this book include scholars in mathematics education and teacher education teacher educators staff developers and classroom teachers. It is also appropriate as a text for graduate courses in mathematics education teacher education elementary mathematics teaching methods and methods of research in mathematics education.",
